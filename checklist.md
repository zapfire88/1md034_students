- [ ] Add the Vue instance example code to vue_script.js 
- [ ] Update js_script.js with your JSFiddle code and update vue_script.js with your Vue version
- [ ] Update js_script.js and vue_script.js again with your array + loop solutions

- [ ] Update vue_script.js to get the burgers from menu.js instead
- [ ] Create an event listener in js_script.js connected to your order button

- [ ] Comment out your previous event listener and use Vue's corresponding functionality in vue_script.js and index.html to react on button presses

## 05 Messaging

- [ ] Exchange the fields for the customer's address with the interactive map
- [ ] Copy the parts of deli-very.js that you need to make the map work into vue_script.js
- [ ] Check that your map works and adjust the coordinates if the dots don't show up in the right place.
- [ ] Separate addOrder into one function that controls what should happen when a user clicks in the map (displayOrder) and rewrite addOrder to control what should happen when the user clicks the order button
- [ ] Remove the socket.on bindings to "currentQueue" and "initialize", and temporarily fix getNext to assign locally generated orderId's when an order is sent
- [ ] Send the actual burgers with the order instead of Beans and Curry
- [ ] Send the customer's information from your input fields with the order
- [ ] Update the dispatcher view so that you see the following for every order:
    - [ ] The order's location on the map
    - [ ] The ordered burger(-s)
    - [ ] The customer's information
    
## Optional
- [ ] Set the orderID on the server side so that multiple customers can add orders
- [ ] Only allow the order to be sent if all necessary information is provided
- [ ] Display multiple orders on the customer page
- [ ] Allow the dispatcher to handle orders by providing buttons next to every order that can switch the order status to "in preparation" and "done"
- [ ] Display the order status to the customer and update it in the customer view if updated by the dispatcher
- [ ] Find a better visualization for what orders belong to which location on the map
